                This study is a brief examination of the methodological
                challenges and the constitution of "evidence" within the domain
                of feral swine (Sus scrofa) population monitoring across the
                United States. Finding conceptual parallels with some of the
                ideas found in H.M. Collins' analysis of evidential cultures in
                physics, I conducted this review with principles of evidential
                culture in mind.[1]

                <!-- A specific goal was to determine if information shared
                openly online might better contribute to the work of researchers in
                universities that have an open evidential culture, and whether
                professional researchers might benefit from such information. -->

              <p class="mx-auto">
                The monitoring of feral swine populations represents a
                particularly instructive case for examining the tension between
                formalized scientific practices and distributed observational
                networks. These invasive mammals have established themselves
                across the United States, and have an estimated population
                exceeding 6 million. Recognized as one of the world's most
                destructive invasive species, these animals pose substantial
                threats to agricultural ecosystems and rural economies. [2,3]
              </p>
              <p class="mx-auto">
                Yet despite their economic and ecological significance, no
                coherent national framework exists for monitoring their
                population. Through systematic review of publicly available data
                sources, including state wildlife agencies, federal departments,
                and specialized hunting resources, I identified significant
                inconsistencies in estimation methodologies, reporting
                standards, and data accessibility. There were wide variations in
                population reporting formats, from single-point estimates to
                broad numerical ranges, that complicated cross-state
                comparisons. The fragmentation extends beyond mere technical
                differences to reveal deeper questions about what constitutes
                legitimate knowledge in this domain: Whose observations count?
                Which methodologies are privileged? How might the boundaries
                between "formal" and "informal" knowledge be productively
                reconfigured?
              </p>
              <p class="mx-auto">
                This investigation concludes that technology, and the principles
                of open evidential culture should be leveraged to construct more
                robust knowledge about feral swine populations through the
                strategic integration of academic expertise and distributed
                observational networks.

            I began my literature review by examining publicly available
            resources on feral swine populations across the United States. My
            search focused on government agencies, university websites, and
            specialized hunting resources that provide population data.
          </p>
          <p class="mx-auto">
            <img src="img/hog.jpg" alt="image2" class="swine-image-two" />
            Online literature reveals a lack of methodological consistency in
            how feral swine populations are monitored and reported. While the
            biological and ecological dimensions of the feral swine lifecycle
            have received substantial scholarly attention, considerably less
            research has focused on the methodological challenges inherent in
            population monitoring and the resulting data inconsistencies.
          </p>
          <p class="mx-auto">
            Studies have attempted to quantify feral swine populations at state
            or regional levels using various methodologies, including camera
            trapping (Massei et al., 2018), mark-recapture techniques (Hanson et
            al., 2008), and aerial surveys (Campbell et al., 2010). However,
            these approaches vary significantly in their implementation,
            accuracy, and geographic coverage. The resulting heterogeneity in
            population estimation methodologies must create substantial
            challenges for policymakers and wildlife managers attempting to
            allocate resources effectively or evaluate management success (or
            failure) across jurisdictional boundaries.[4,5,6]
          </p>
          <p class="mx-auto">
            Federal and State agencies vary dramatically in their approaches,
            with some providing detailed population estimates (Texas, Florida)
            while others offer only vague qualitative assessments (North
            Carolina, Oklahoma). Lack of consistent standards to determine how
            population data for feral swine should be collected, reported, and
            utilized across different states and agencies impedes the
            development of coordinated management strategies and prevents
            accurate assessment of population trends at regional or national
            scales. It also prevents researchers from effectively combining
            their data and perhaps reaching useful conclusions.
          </p>
          <p class="mx-auto">
            This review identified a significant gap in the literature regarding
            standardized methodologies for feral swine population assessment
            across jurisdictional boundaries, highlighting the need for improved
            coordination between researchers and management agencies, and
            opportunities to expand the most successful of the approaches that I
            found.

            Data for this case study was collected online, from websites that
            are freely available to the general public. The goal was to be
            inclusive in my approach, and determine if useful data about feral
            swine (Sus scrofa (feral type) Linnaeus) populations across the
            United States exists online, or if the means to create such data
            could be developed. The selection of this invasive species as an
            analytical object was especially interesting because their
            population exceeds 6 million individuals and causes extensive
            ecological and economic disruption, but approaches to data gathering
            and study of the subject by different knowledge systems are
            inconsistent and often ineffective.
          </p>

          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            The methodological approach was informed by Collins'
            conceptualization of evidential cultures as socially-constructed
            frameworks governing what counts as legitimate knowledge. Feral
            swine data provides a particularly illuminating case for such
            analysis precisely because it exists at the intersection of multiple
            institutional domains—state wildlife management, academic research,
            agricultural policy, and recreational hunting—each with distinct
            epistemic commitments and data practices. This diversity of
            approaches creates natural variation in evidential standards that
            can be analyzed and compared.

            I systematically reviewed publicly-available online resources
            produced by state wildlife agencies, research universities, and
            specialized hunting resources with online records of feral swine
            populations. For each source, I reviewed the type of population data
            provided, the methodology used for estimation (if disclosed), the
            frequency of updates, and the accessibility of raw data- testing the
            hypothesis that democratized access to knowledge might reveal
            alternative evidential regimes outside traditional mechanisms. I
            looked at the content of population estimates, and also the material
            practices through which such estimates were generated, including:
            the explicit and implicit methodologies deployed for population
            assessment, the technical and social infrastructures governing data
            accessibility, and the rhetorical framing of certainty and
            uncertainty within different knowledge communities.

          The USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)
          maintains some of the most comprehensive data on feral swine
          distribution but offers limited granularity on population sizes, and
          State wildlife agencies are not much better in their reporting
          practices. In my review of publicly available feral swine population
          data, I found striking inconsistencies in how data is reported. The
          Texas Parks and Wildlife Department reports "about 2.6 million" feral
          swine, while Georgia's Department of Natural Resources provides a
          broad range of "200,000 to 600,000." Florida's Fish and Wildlife
          Conservation Commission simply states "over one-half million."[7,8,9]
          These variations in reporting format—from single-point estimates to
          wide numerical ranges—make meaningful cross-state comparisons nearly
          impossible. Since there is significant epistemological fragmentation
          regarding the nature of data in this domain, it falls to researchers
          to form workable processes and procedures.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          How data is labelled can also make it difficult to determine what is
          being tracked, and whether there are trends. These are not merely
          differences in reporting format, but represent fundamentally different
          accommodations between precision and accuracy. How should we represent
          uncertain knowledge through numbers? The Arkansas Department of
          Agriculture tracks "removal" data, while Louisiana refers to
          "harvesting," and Oklahoma uses "take" figures to describe how many
          hogs are killed.[10, 11, 12] State agencies seem to be struggling to
          determine what to report to the public, and have not defined any
          standardized practices. In all fairness, it is a difficult problem.
          Falyn Owens, a wildlife biologist with the North Carolina Wildlife
          Resources Commission, explained that "We don't in North Carolina have
          a good estimate of the population of feral swine across the state
          because it's a really, really hard number to pin down" —a rare
          institutional acknowledgment of what Collins terms "experimental
          regress," the recognition that measurement uncertainty may be
          fundamentally irreducible rather than merely technical.[13, 14]
        </p>
        <!-- <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          Even more concerning is the scarcity of methodological transparency.
          Few state agencies disclose their estimation techniques, and when they
          do, they rarely provide sufficient detail to evaluate reliability.
          

           Viewing this data landscape through the lens of evidential culture
          reveals a tension between open and closed approaches.

          The investigation identified promising alternative knowledge regimes
          operating outside traditional institutional boundaries.[15,16,17] The
          hunting-focused commercial platform Captain Experiences, in
          particular, deserves mention, as it integrates recreational hunting
          information with scientific data sourced from the University of
          Georgia's Center for Invasive Species and Ecosystem Health[18] to
          construct a fifteen-state ranking list based on EDDMapS (Early
          Detection & Distribution Mapping System) data.
        </p>
        <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
          What distinguishes this commercial platform is not merely its use of
          data but its explicit methodological transparency: "To determine the
          states with the biggest wild hog problem, researchers at Captain
          Experiences calculated the number of feral hog sightings reported in
          each state. In the event of a tie, the state with the greater
          percentage of counties with feral hogs was ranked higher." This
          methodological declaration—uncharacteristic of commercial
          platforms—represents an incursion of scientific evidential standards
          into non-academic domains. My one criticism of Captain Experiences is
          that they use the data but do not encourage their members to help
          report new information to the EDDMapS site. Hunting organizations and
          citizen science platforms are promising sources of hands-on data to
          help support researchers, and together they could build a foundation
          of research best practices that state and federal agencies might
          adopt.

          validated data entered by informed observers and made freely available
          to everyone on their website. The work that the University of
          Georgia's EDDMapS site is significant, and might be considered an
          attempt to reconfigure the boundaries between expert and non-expert
          knowledge production. Established in 2005, this system was initially
          designed for specialized institutional use but has evolved into a
          continent-spanning infrastructure for citizen science. Its
          methodological innovation lies in creating what might be termed a
          "calibrated democratization" of data collection—opening observation to
          any participant while subjecting contributions to expert verification

          This hybrid model represents a productive tension between open and

          of invasive species monitoring: how to achieve sufficient
          observational scale while maintaining scientific credibility. This
          democratized approach to data collection could harness the
          observational power of thousands of individuals across the continent,
          creating a far more extensive monitoring network than any single
          institution could maintain, and their standardized approach to
          presenting data across states offers a rare opportunity for direct
          comparison that is absent from most government resources.

          I was disappointed to discover that their feral hog records only

          records might not be considered to be a technical failure, but as an
          ongoing negotiation between existing processes and emerging practices
          of distributed knowledge production. There is a unique opportunity for
          hunters, and others who benefit from feral hog tracking, to contribute

          helped and hindered public knowledge. While these sites often provide
          accessible and visually compelling data presentations, their
          scientific utility is limited by their source attribution. This
          limitation is particularly noteworthy given that at least one of these
          resources was cited by a news media outlet: there is a public desire
          for such information. [20]

              My analysis supports previous research by Campbell et al. (2010)
              and Hanson et al. (2008) who identified methodological
              inconsistencies in wildlife population monitoring. However, my
              findings extend this work by specifically documenting how these
              inconsistencies manifest in publicly available data sources across
              jurisdictional boundaries. The current situation creates isolated
              repositories of information that cannot be meaningfully integrated
              or understood. Texas, for example, is a large state. Is that the
              reason why it shows the highest numbers? Also, should we be
              considering the fact that unequal numbers of researchers recording
              and reporting signtings might skew the results?[5,6]

              The biological and behavioral characteristics of feral swine—their
              adaptability, nocturnal habits, and responses to hunting
              pressure—create inherent challenges in population estimation.
              However, these natural difficulties are compounded by
              institutional and methodological fragmentation. When Georgia
              reports a population range of "200,000 to 600,000" while
              neighboring Florida simply states "over one-half million," the
              utility of such figures for cross-state management planning is
              severely limited. These are not merely different numerical
              expressions but distinct systems of knowledge production whose
              outputs cannot be meaningfully integrated because they rest on
              different implicit assumptions about what constitutes valid
              evidence.[8,9]

              This study has several limitations worth acknowledging. First, I
              focused exclusively on publicly available online resources, which
              may not reflect the full scope of data available to wildlife
              managers through internal channels, or to experts in universities
              who have access to professional journals and data sites. There is
              a "tacit knowledge" circulating within closed professional
              communities—the unwritten expertise and judgment cultivated within
              wildlife management agencies and academic research groups, which I
              do not have access to as an outsider. Second, my analysis was
              limited to English-language resources, potentially missing
              valuable contributions from international research on feral swine
              management. Finally, the rapidly evolving nature of online
              resources means that some data sources may have been updated since
              my review.

              Despite these considerations, my analysis reveals the University
              of Georgia's EDDMapS as an exemplary case of what Collins might
              term "interactional expertise"—a system designed to facilitate
              productive exchange between different knowledge communities while
              preserving distinct epistemological commitments. By creating
              mechanisms for amateur contributions while maintaining expert
              verification, EDDMapS demonstrates how the apparent opposition
              between "open" and "closed" evidential cultures might be
              productively reconfigured into complementary rather than competing
              knowledge systems.

        <div>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            This investigation reveals not merely technical inconsistencies but
            a fundamental fragmentation in the evidential cultures that shape
            our collective knowledge of feral swine populations across the
            United States. This epistemic fragmentation manifests in what
            Collins would recognize as competing "truth regimes"—different
            institutional frameworks that establish incompatible standards for
            what constitutes valid knowledge. The consequence is not simply a
            lack of standardization but a more profound inability to establish a
            coherent collective understanding of a significant ecological
            phenomenon.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            When examined through Collins' conceptual framework, the current
            landscape reveals a productive tension between closed evidential
            cultures (typified by state wildlife agencies that restrict access
            to raw data, or designate the importance of data differently) and
            more open frameworks (represented by hunting organizations and
            citizen science platforms that prioritize geographic coverage and
            observational volume). These are not merely different approaches to
            the same epistemic project but represent fundamentally different
            conceptions of how knowledge about ecological systems should be
            constituted and validated. In practical terms, this epistemic
            fragmentation helps explain why coordinated management efforts have
            struggled despite decades of institutional attention—without shared
            evidential standards, collective action becomes unsustainable.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            While information is readily accessible on the internet, its
            superabundance can cause valuable insights to be buried beneath
            mountains of low-quality content. Algorithms that point researchers
            to the information that is most popular might miss the information
            that is most valid. To address this issue, I propose developing
            expert-curated lists that connect users to reliable information
            vetted by specialists in the field. Academic institutions could play
            a crucial role in this epistemic architecture, allowing students to
            make meaningful contributions to ongoing research initiatives that
            continue beyond their academic tenure. Eventually, these efforts
            would accumulate into comprehensive databases housing years of
            consistently formatted data—something we currently lack in today's
            information ecosystem.
          </p>
          <!-- <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            Despite these limitations, my findings clearly indicate that the
            current state of feral swine population data represents a missed
            opportunity for collaborative research and management. The
            University of Georgia's EDDMapS demonstrates how researchers can
            effectively bridge open and closed evidential cultures by harnessing
            amateur contributions while maintaining scientific rigor through
            expert verification.

        </div>
        <div class="pb-2 mx-auto h2">Recommendations</div>
        <div>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            Future research should focus not merely on standardizing technical
            protocols but on fostering what Collins terms "interactional
            expertise"—the capacity to move productively between different
            knowledge communities without requiring their complete integration.
            The University of Georgia's EDDMapS exemplifies this approach,
            creating mechanisms for knowledge exchange while preserving the
            distinct contributions of different evidential cultures.
          </p>
          <p class="pb-2 mx-auto">
            Universities are uniquely positioned to function as epistemic
            mediators in this process, possessing both the scientific authority
            to validate methodological approaches and the institutional capacity
            to engage diverse stakeholder communities. By creating platforms for
            interdisciplinary collaboration that explicitly acknowledge rather
            than suppress evidential differences, academic institutions could
            foster a more robust collective understanding of complex ecological
            phenomena like feral swine populations—simultaneously accommodating
            the scientific rigor privileged by academic research, the
            geographical coverage enabled by citizen observation, and the
            practical knowledge embedded in hunting and agricultural
            communities.
